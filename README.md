## Bedrock Mini

### A mini prototyping setup

One step up from Codepen - work in your local environment using the handiness of Jade and SCSS with autoprefixing.

* Renders Jade templates
* Has Browsersync starting a local server
* Compiles SCSS
* Already has references to jQuery in place, and a script tag to begin your JS

If you need more power, a styleguide, better navigation between templates, consider <a href="http://bedrock.mono.company/">Bedrock</a>.

### Instructions

* Put your Jade files in `src`
* Put your SCSS files in `scss`

* Run `npm install` then `gulp` to start working
